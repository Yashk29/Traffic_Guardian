# Traffic Guardian

The **Traffic Guardian** project aims to improve road safety by detecting traffic violations and objects in real time using object detection techniques. The system utilizes the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** model for detecting various objects like vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signals, with the goal of monitoring and alerting about potential violations.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Detects vehicles, pedestrians, and other objects in traffic environments.
- **Violation Monitoring**: Monitors traffic behavior to identify potential violations, such as crossing signals or speeding.
- **YOLO Model Integration**: Uses the YOLO object detection model for fast and accurate detection of traffic-related objects.

## My Role - Object Detection with YOLO

- **Object Detection Implementation**: I was responsible for implementing object detection using the **YOLO model**. I trained and optimized the model to detect objects relevant to traffic scenarios, including cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs.
- **Model Integration**: I integrated the YOLO model with the system, ensuring smooth real-time detection and processing.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Deep learning-based object detection algorithm used for recognizing and tracking objects in real time.
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library used for image and video processing.
- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the detection algorithms.
- **Flask** (Optional): For serving the results through a web-based interface (if used in the project).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-guardian.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd traffic-guardian
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the detection system:

   ```bash
   python detect.py
   ```

## How It Works

- **YOLO Object Detection**: The system processes video streams or images, applying the YOLO model to detect objects such as vehicles and pedestrians.
- **Violation Monitoring**: If any potential violation is detected (e.g., crossing a signal), the system generates an alert or logs the violation.

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-Time Traffic Violation Detection**: Implement additional modules to detect specific traffic violations like speeding, signal jumping, etc.
- **Data Logging**: Develop a feature to log detected violations for further analysis.
- **Advanced Model Training**: Train the YOLO model with more specific datasets to improve accuracy in detecting violations.
